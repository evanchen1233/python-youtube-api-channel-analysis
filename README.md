Youtube api analysis of channel "James Hoffmann"

Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.

Analyzing video data and verify different common "myths" about what makes a video do well on Youtube, for example:

Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?

Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?

Does title length matter for views?

How many tags do good performing videos have? What are the common tags among these videos?

how often do they upload new videos? On which days in the week?

Explore the trending topics using NLP techniques

Which popular topics are being covered in the videos (e.g. using wordcloud for video titles)?
